## SECTION 1 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

The application for Artificial Intelligence (AI) game environments serves as an infinite supply
of useful data for machine learning algorithms making them a desired domain for AI
research. AI in these game environments has been helping us understand how games are
played in terms of the strategies devised, the efficacy of the different algorithms used in play
and also how game design may be enhanced.

These aspects pose three fundamental challenges with its own proposed approaches to
solving them. The first challenge is that the state space in strategic games is very large , but
this has been modelled with the neural networks using approaches such as deep Q learning.
Secondly, the learning of proper policies for decision making in dynamic unknown
environments is difficult, but the use of data driven methodology such as reinforcement
learning (RL) provides feasible solutions. Lastly , as most AI is developed for a specified virtual
environment, this poses the question of how best to transfer AIâ€™s capability generic enough
to make it adaptable to other systems. In addition, these game environments provide
infinite supply of useful data for machine learning algorithms, and they are much faster than
real-time. These characteristics make games the unique and favorite domain for AI research.
On the other side, AI has been helping games to become better in the way we play,
understand and design them.

This project is an attempt to apply Reinforcement and Evolutionary Learning techniques to
the gameplay environment of MsPacman. It would be prudent to discuss the nature of the
game environment before deciding and explaining on the choice of the appropriate
algorithms of the learning models to apply
